    This file demonstrates how to use EDB to create a chemical reactor that
    involves vapor-liquid equilibrium.

    (1) Before we can start, you must install MongoDB (which is installed separately)

        [See more information on the ReadTheDocs under 'Getting Started --> Installing WaterTAP']


    (2) After installing MongoDB, you will need to 'load' the database using the
        command line function 'edb load -b'. This will load the default database
        that WaterTAP is bundled with.

        [NOTE: If you need to 'reload' the database, simply use the command 'edb drop -d electrolytedb'
                in the command line. The database on MongoDB is named "electrolytedb"]

        [NOTE 2: You can invoke the command line utility with the "help" keyword to
                get more information on funtionality. Command: 'edb --help' or 'edb [arg] --help']


    (3) To use EDB in python, start by importing the interface class object 'ElectrolyteDB'


    (4) Invoke the 'ElectrolyteDB' object to connect to the database


    (5) Grab a 'base' for a configuration dictionary, and place it into a class object
        This time, we will grab a base that is for a Liq-Vap problem using FpcTP
        state variables.


    (6) Get the chemcial species/components for a simulation case. There are a number of ways
        to do this. In this example, we will grab them by finding all components that contain
        only specific elements. Then, we add those components and their associated parameters
        to the configuration dictionary being built from the 'base'.

        [NOTE: An alternative method is to provide a list of the names of components you want]


    (7) Get the set of reactions you want in your system and put into a 'base' object.
        In this case, we are getting all reactions associated with a system of water
        and carbonic acid. We should get four reactions now::

            H2O <--> H_+ + OH_-
            H2CO3 <--> H_+ + HCO3_-
            HCO3_- <--> H_+ + CO3_2-
            CO2 + H2O <--> H2CO3


    (8) When using an reactor object in IDAES, you must always provide a 'reaction_config'
        to match with the 'thermo_config'. We can create a base 'reaction' config from
        the database and add reactions to that config in the same way we do for the
        'thermo_config' when adding reactions as inherent.

        [NOTE: If a reaction is added to a 'thermo_config' as 'inherent', it should
               NOT be added to a 'reaction_config' as 'equilibrium']


    (9) Build an equilibrium reactor from the 'thermo_config' and 'reaction_config'
        that were generated from the EDB.
