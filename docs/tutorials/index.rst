Tutorials
=========

Since WaterTAP is based on the IDAES platform and follows its conventions,
the `IDAES tutorials <https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/tutorials_examples.html>`_ are a good starting point for learning how to use WaterTAP.

In particular, new users should be familiar with Python and Pyomo. Because WaterTAP
and IDAES share this common base, we refer users unfamiliar with Python or Pyomo to
the IDAES tutorials `Short introduction to Python and Pyomo <https://idaes.github.io/examples-pse/latest/Tutorials/Basics/introduction_short_solution_doc.html>`_ or the 
`Longer introduction to Python and Pyomo <https://idaes.github.io/examples-pse/latest/Tutorials/Basics/introduction_solution_doc.html>`_.

The tutorials included with WaterTAP are available in the "tutorials" directory
on the WaterTAP GitHub Homepage: `<https://github.com/watertap-org/watertap/tree/main/tutorials>`_.
